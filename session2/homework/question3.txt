Nested conditional is conditional nested within another

Ex: 
if gender == "female"
  if age > 18
    print("This person is legal to get married")
  else 
    print("This person is illegal to get married")
    
else gender == "male"
  if age > 21
    print("This person is legal to get married")
  else 
    print("This person is illegal to get married")
